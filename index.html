            <h2>This is a useless website...</h2>
            <p>
                ...but I appreciate you being here anyway. You're on my very first built-from-scratch website and I'm
                sure it shows. But hey, everyone starts somewhere, right? Wrong, that's Marxist propaganda and I won't
                stand for it. Don't make excuses, pull yourself up by your bootstraps and learn to code better so that
                when people come to your website they actually enjoy the experience. I can't even look at you.
            </p>
            <h2>Why is your website structured like this?</h2>
            <p>
                Look, I didn't make all these decisions. The spec for this website had certain requirements,
                so here we are. I mean, I'm sure they still wanted it to look somewhat decent, so at the end of the day
                the blame would normally fall squarely on my Atlas-sized shoulders; however, I thought it was important
                not to make the other students in my cohort jealous. I can't just fire out here designing
                Squarespace-level
                shit on day one, right? People would be upset, cliques would form, revolutions would be plotted, and all
                because I couldn't just practice a tiny bit of humility.
            </p>
            <h2>Sounds like you're just making excuses for a crappy website.</h2>
            <p>
                Wow, look at Sherlock Holmes over here. OK fine, that's exactly what I'm doing, and I feel no remorse.
